            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bon Marché, San Francisco, USA.</h1><p>Among the eateries revitalising San Francisco's once-gritty Mid-Market neighborhood into the city's most buzzy food and drinks corridor is Bon Marché, a sunny Californian take on Le Marais. This 7500-square-foot space combines a café, a brewery, an oyster bar, a full-service restaurant, and even a flower shop that doubles as a stage for live jazz at night.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f67536b56e8543128b8b1122f673dc5d50a01f50.jpg"></article>]]></description>

While the complete results won't be formally announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch Colorado Straight Rye.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b64dca9b02fd08fb329890c39fa2430abff82993.jpg"></article>]]></description>
